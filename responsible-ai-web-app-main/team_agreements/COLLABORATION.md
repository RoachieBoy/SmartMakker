## 1. House Rules

In the following subchapters all general collaboration regulations are described in-depth. 

### 1.1 Conventions

Each team member will follow the conventions as described in [this file](CONVENTIONS.md). These conventions will be 
dynamic in nature, so each team member is responsible for keeping up-to-date with eventual changes. 

### 1.2 Attendance

Each team member should attend the planned team sessions. There are a few exceptions to this rule:

1. Illness
2. Travel Disturbances
3. Personal Circumstances ([see 1.2.1](#121-personal-circumstances))

#### 1.2.1 Personal Circumstances

Personal circumstances can be one of the following:

- Family Emergency
- Medical Emergency
- Work Emergency

If a team member cannot attend a session for one of the above listed reasons, they are required to post an announcement 
in the shared discord server. This announcement should be posted in the announcements channel and each remaining 
team member should be @'d. This announcement is required to be posted as soon as possible (depending on the reason
of absence the time can vary). 

### 1.3 Deadlines

The team members agree to adhere to the following deadlines for the completion of the project:

#### 1.3.1 Review & Retro

Yuri should be invited at the end & Suzanna should be invited at the beginning of every review.

- 24/03/2023
- 14/04/2023
- 05/05/2023
- 26/05/2023

#### 1.3.2 Refinement

Every Wednesday from 22/03/2023 till the end of the project.

#### 1.3.3 Attendance

If either Party is unable to meet on a deadline, they must notify the other Party at least 2 days in advance and propose an alternative deadline.

If the parties cannot agree on an alternative deadline, they will follow the Disagreement Procedure outlined below.

### 1.4 Communication

All team related communication should be handled via the shared discord server. When the communication involves a teacher 
or other member of HvA staff, the communication should be handled via teams in the shared Responsible-AI channel.

All feedback should be helpful, neutral or positive in nature. Unsubstantiated and/or ill-intended feedback is 
not warranted, and can result in a written warning. 

### 1.5 Team Roles

Per scrum methodology we will be using the following team roles:

> For more information on the specifics of each role, see: [Scrum Team](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-team)

#### 1.5.1 Product Owner

*The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.*

    Name: Winand Metz

#### 1.5.2 Scrum Master

*The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.*

    Name: Caleigh Esterhuyse

#### 1.5.3 Developer

*Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.*

    All parties

## 2. Disagreement Procedure

In the event of a disagreement between the Parties regarding the Project, the Parties agree to follow the following procedure:

1. The team members will attempt to resolve the disagreement through informal discussion and negotiation.
2. If informal discussion and negotiation are unsuccessful, each involved party will receive a written warning and the settling procedure ([see 2.1](#21-settling))  will be enacted.
3. If the settling procedure is unsuccessful, either party may terminate ([see 4](#4-termination)) this collaboration agreement.

Each party agrees to cooperate in good faith to resolve any disagreements in a timely and amicable manner.

### 2.1 Settling

The team members will attempt to resolve any disagreements through mediation with a teacher, coach or other member of staff agreed upon by all parties.

## 3 Penalties

In this chapter the penalty system will be explained.

> A penalty is equivalent to a written warning.

### 3.1 Process

The following procedures are applied when dealing with penalties:

- The warnings will be handled by the Scrum Master. These warnings will be stored in a separate warnings channel in the shared discord server.
- In the case that the Scrum Master is directly involved in the conflict, warnings will be handled by the Product Owner.
- In the case that every team member is involved in the conflict, a neutral third party (preferably the project coach) will be contacted to help deal with the problem.

### 3.2 Consequences

If a party receives more than two written warnings, the disagreement procedure as described in [chapter 2](#2-disagreement-procedure) will be enacted.

## 4 Termination

In the event of termination, each party will retain the work product they have created up to that point and will not be entitled to any compensation from the other party.
